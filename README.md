Hi, I'm Praveen Pondugalaüëã
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I‚Äôm a passionate full-stack web developer, an avid cricket enthusiast, and an open-minded individual eager to learn and explore new technologies.

üöÄ What I'm Building*
I'm constantly working on exciting projects that leverage modern web technologies. 

Currently, I'm particularly focused on:

*Building scalable and robust backend APIs with Java Spring Boot.
Crafting dynamic and intuitive user interfaces using HTML and CSS.
Exploring the power of cloud platforms, with foundational knowledge in AWS services like IAM, EC2, and S3, and basic understanding of relational databases (RDB).
Developing AI-driven solutions using Python, OpenCV, YOLO, and Haar Cascade.*

*My projects include:*

## Exam Guard: Student Behaviour Monitoring System:
An AI-driven proctoring tool using Python, OpenCV, YOLO, and Haar Cascade to detect suspicious exam behavior, accurately identifying multiple faces, mobile phone usage, and head movements in real time with over 90% accuracy. It minimizes the need for manual invigilation through automatic alerts and visual incident reports and utilizes open-source tools and lightweight models for high performance at minimal cost.

## Automated Hostel Management System:
A Java-based full-stack web application developed using Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. It applies OOP principles and SDLC to create modules for student registration, fee tracking, and room allotment , and uses JDBC for seamless database integration with clean, maintainable Java code. This system improved user experience and admin productivity by automating key hostel operations.

## Smart Color Guide for the Visually Impaired:
An IoT-based device developed using ESP8266 NodeMCU and a TCS3200 color sensor to assist visually impaired individuals. It enables real-time color detection with 94% accuracy and auditory feedback through a Bluetooth module with 95% reliability. The device is designed and assembled to be portable and energy-efficient for daily use, helping visually impaired users independently select clothing and identify objects by color.
